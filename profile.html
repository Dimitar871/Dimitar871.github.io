                <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold text-gray-900 text-center">Why? and what do you hope to have learned in four years?</h1>
                <p class="text-xl text-gray-800">I am passionate about becoming a tech entrepreneur, creating a startup that focuses on developing innovative software solutions or products that address pressing needs in the market. I am especially drawn to fields like artificial intelligence and cybersecurity, as these areas are rapidly evolving and have the potential to transform industries and daily life. By founding my own company, I would have the creative freedom to explore new ideas, innovate, and build a team of like-minded individuals dedicated to pushing the boundaries of technology.</p>

                <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold text-gray-900 text-center">What do you see yourself doing after completing the program?</h1>
                <p class="text-xl text-gray-800">I have a few hobbies and interests that I’m really passionate about. One of my main hobbies is going to the gym. I enjoy working out because it helps me stay fit and healthy, and it's a great way to relieve stress. I like challenging myself with different workouts, whether it’s weightlifting, cardio, or trying out new fitness programs. Going to the gym has become an important part of my routine, and I love seeing the progress I make over time. Recently, I’ve developed an interest in learning how to fish. I’ve never been fishing before, but I’m intrigued by the idea of being outdoors, enjoying nature, and learning a new skill. Fishing seems like a relaxing yet rewarding activity that requires patience and technique, and I’m eager to give it a try.</p>

                <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold text-gray-900 text-center">Strengths</h1>
                <p class="text-xl text-gray-800">My biggest strengths are my skills in working with a team and my endless creativity. I thrive in collaborative environments where I can connect with others, share ideas, and work towards common goals. I believe that effective teamwork is all about communication, mutual respect, and leveraging each person's strengths to achieve the best outcome. I’m always ready to listen to others, contribute my ideas, and help create an inclusive and productive team atmosphere.</p>

                <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold text-gray-900 text-center">Weaknesses</h1>
                <p class="text-xl text-gray-800">My biggest weakness is that I tend to make fast decisions, which sometimes aren’t as well thought-out as they should be. While my quick decision-making can be beneficial in situations that require rapid responses, it can also lead to overlooking important details.</p>
